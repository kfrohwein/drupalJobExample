# Drupal job board Demo

As desired I did install a latest D8 and used the composer skeleton for it.

I kept the installation minimal and added only a "Recruiter" user role so that recruiter could
add new job offerings. And a node type "Job" with some useful taxonomies.

Please keep in mind that a full fledged Job platform would take more than 300 days and 
will not be build by me in some hours.

## Stories and agile
I am quiet experienced in Drupal site building and know how to configure views,
the block model, theme inheritance, display modes, paragraphs and on and on...
I could easily spend hours or even days on that. Again from my perspective the stories are really vague
and I full filled easily what is asked. If I now take the examples you gave and tried
to rebuild those I would be lost! So what I would do is get the PO and build a prototype
asap and show that to the customer to get feedback. I really believe here in "Demo or die"
and building a mvp. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jhf7PcYrzY

# Programming example
As programming test I chose not to use webforms for the job appliance but create a module
by myself and add there a simple entity and a a form by the FAPI.
